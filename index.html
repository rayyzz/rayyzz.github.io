									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pokemon1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pokemon2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a two-player Pokemon game, designed to provide an engaging gaming experience for players. At the start of the game, each player selects a Pokemon from a carefully curated selection of three.

										During each turn, players have the option to choose from two different moves, both of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. The objective of the game is to reduce the opposing Pokemon's health points to zero, thereby achieving victory.
										
										The game was developed using the programming language Java, and consists of three different classes: a main class, player class, and a Pokemon class. These classes have been designed to work seamlessly together to create a robust and engaging gaming experience for players.
										
										Overall, this game is a testament to the capabilities of Java as a programming language, and showcases the ability of developers to create engaging games using powerful programming tools.
