									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Hello! Read about me below.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My name is Raiyan Islam, and I am currently in my fourth year at Toronto Metropolitan University, studying software engineering. I have always had a passion for technology, programming, and software, and that is what inspired me to pursue this field of study.</p>
								<p>During my time at university, I have gained a lot of knowledge about software engineering and programming. I am proficient in many programming languages, including Python, Java, and C, and I have also learned a lot about data structures and algorithms. I consider myself a good problem solver, and I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am looking for an internship in the software industry to gain practical experience and apply my knowledge to real-world projects. I am eager to learn from experienced professionals in the industry and contribute my skills to the team. I am confident that my passion for technology, programming, and software, along with my knowledge and problem-solving skills, make me an ideal candidate for any software engineering role.</p>
								<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>
